    "### Classifying Hateful Word Senses in Context - Annotation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study you will be provided with sentences that mention a particular target term in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **id** | **example** | **term** | **pos** | **sense_id** | **definition** | **ANNOTATION** | **DEFICIENT SENTENCE** |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 448 | The bugger’s given me the wrong change. | bugger | noun | 3 | A foolish or worthless person or thing; a despicable person. |  |  |\n",
    "\n",
    "The example sentences can originate from different textual sources (e.g. social media, news, literature), from different time periods (predominantly modern but also e.g. 18th century English) and in different English dialects (e.g. US, UK or Australian English). As the default setting, the color of the definition text is white to make it invisible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a target term and a sentence in which the target term occurs, your task is to rate the hatefulness of the meaning of the target word within this specific sentence. Indicate your hatefulness rating in the column 'ANNOTATION' by choosing one of the following labels:\n",
    "| Label |                  |\n",
    "|-------|------------------|\n",
    "| 0     | Not hateful      |\n",
    "| 1     | Weakly hateful   |\n",
    "| 2     | Strongly hateful |\n",
    "| -     | Cannot decide    |\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE: the annotated examples provided in these guidelines don't display ground truth annotations; the rating of hatefulness that is aimed for in this study is subjective i.e. there are no right or wrong annotations, and you could disagree with the provided annotations._\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "| **id** | **example** | **term** | **pos** | **sense_id** | **definition** | **ANNOTATION** | **DEFICIENT SENTENCE** |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 1848 | I took my girl to the cinema to watch your American movies. | girl | noun | 6 |  | 0 |  |\n",
    "| 166 | Some bastard stole my car while I was helping an injured person. | bastard | noun | 3 |  | 1 |  |\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot rate the hatefulness based on the sentence alone, e.g. you are not familiar with the term's sense or the sentence still leaves room for term ambiguity, you can use the term's sense definition for your judgment by making the definition text visible (i.e. changing the font color). Please indicate this in the column 'DEFICIENT SENTENCE' with \"True\". For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **id** | **example** | **term** | **pos** | **sense_id** | **definition** | **ANNOTATION** | **DEFICIENT SENTENCE** |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 3687 | “Trump simp”. | simp | noun | 4 | Someone who foolishly overvalues someone else and defers to them, putting them on a pedestal. | 1 | True |\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can not make a judgment given both the sentence _and_ the sense definition (e.g. the sentence is too poorly written and/or the sense definition is not providing (enough) information about its hatefulness), please indicate this with \"-\" in the column 'ANNOTATION' _and_ with \"True\" in the column 'DEFICIENT SENTENCE'. For example:\n",
    "| **id** | **example** | **term** | **pos** | **sense_id** | **definition** | **ANNOTATION** | **DEFICIENT SENTENCE** |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 27 | Volvo cars now Ah tiong brand.| Ah Tiong | noun | 1 | A mainland Chinese person. | - | True |\n"
